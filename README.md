# K-Means

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.

To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids.
